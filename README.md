# URDF files of robot devices

This repository is created to publicly share URDF files of robot devices, to make it easier for developers to use existing models instead of creating them from scratch in their own.


The python script _urdf_visualiser.py_ can be used to test the urdf files before uploading them. 
The library urdfpy must be installed.
